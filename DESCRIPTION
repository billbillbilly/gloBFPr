Description: Automated access and analysis of multidimensional building profile 
    in cities. The package provides tools to access, search, and download global 
    3D building footprint datasets (3D-GloBFP) generated by 
    Che et al. (2024) <doi:10.5194/essd-16-5357-2024>. 
    It includes functions to retrieve building height tiles, compute a range of 
    multidimensional building morphology metrics, assess environmental context 
    (e.g., greenery accessibility), and support spatial analysis for urban form 
    and density studies.
